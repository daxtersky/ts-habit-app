### Intro

Habits app evolved from everlasting goal to create my first real ToDo App in JavaScript.... but in time the idea went just too simple (not easy) to be interesting... So I've decided to do switch JavaScript to TypeScript, write all the code in accordnance with MCV (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. Data is stored in serverless backend (Google Firebase), and the app styled in SCSS with BEM. Everything bundled by [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and checked by Eslint with Airbnb [configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

### App

For registered users this application enables to add habits, repeating activities in your life.... You wanna keep positive habits to be constantly performed if you believe they will make your life better. And stay away from negative habits! With my app you can keep track of them!........ (more about funtionality).

### Start & development

Start the project in development environment in [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234):

  ```npm i``` // to install all depended libraries

  ```eslint --init``` // to use eslint

  ```parcel index.html``` // to run development environment

  ```git init``` // to create local GIT repository

### Production

```parcel build index.html``` // if simple copy/paste of files prepared by Parcel in folder `/dist` is enough

### Production with GitHub Pages & Parcel?

-> check [Mikey Studio project](https://github.com/daxtersky/mikey-studio) and it's [readme file](https://github.com/daxtersky/mikey-studio/blob/master/README-GITHUB-PARCEL.md)
